            The rather obvious items of vulgarity are listed as VULGAR. There are
            words that AOL considers Vulgar which are TOS violations regardless of
            context. Some of these words Listed as VULGAR are topical in
            nature. That is you would warn if the topic is being discussed, not just
            the word being used.
    
        - name:       Unconditionally Vulgar
          desc:       |
            Conditionally Vulgar: These words would be warned for
            (considered a violation of TOS) depending on the Context. In many cases
            with these words or topics you would CAUTION folks before warning.
    
            Some are warned if they use these words to harass other members. Some
            are warned if used in a sexual way but not warned if they are used in a
            discussion as a medical term. Remember you never have to warn for any of
            these. But should take in the tone of the room and the other member's
            response. When in doubt DON'T warn for these terms. You should use good
            judgement when deciding whether to warn for the Vulgar items on this
            list.
     
            These terms are OK if used as a medical reference or in a way that is
            NONSEXUAL. But can be warned for if someone is just trying to be crude
            or disruptive.
