            The comedian George Carlin had a famous act centering around "Seven
            Filthy Words You Can't Say on Television".  Any list of indecent stop
            words must surely begin here.

            The following is directly quoted from the Supreme Court Decision of
            FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION v. PACIFICA FOUNDATION, 438 U.S. 726,
            98 S.Ct. 3026 (1978).
    
            Mr. Justice STEVENS (delivering the majority opinion)
    
            This case requires that we decide whether the Federal Communications
            Commission has any power to regulate a radio broadcast that is indecent
            but not obscene.
    
            A satiric humorist named George Carlin recorded a 12-minute monologue
            entitled "Filthy Words" before a live audience in a California
            theater. He began by referring to his thoughts about "the words you
            couldn't say on the public, ah, airwaves, um, the ones you definitely
            wouldn't say, ever." He proceeded to list those words and repeat them
            over and over again in a variety of colloquialisms. The transcript of
            the recording, which is appended to this opinion, indicates frequent
            laughter from the audience.
